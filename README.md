# Linear-and-Logistic-Regression-of-Cholesterol-

The goal is to explore relationships among the dataset's features using the statistical methods.
Explore the cholesterol dataset
Use graphical and descriptive methods to investigate the association between triglycerides and BMI
Use simple linear regression to investigate the association between triglycerides and BMI
Use logistic regression to investigate the association between triglycerides and hypertension.
Analyze the association between hypertension and rs174548 adjusted for triglycerides using logistic regression.
